        <h1>The Galápagos tortoise or Galápagos giant tortoise (Chelonoidis niger) is a species of very large tortoise
             in the genus Chelonoidis (which also contains three smaller species from mainland South America). The
              species comprises 15 subspecies (13 extant and 2 extinct). It is the largest living species of
               tortoise, with some modern Galápagos tortoises weighing up to 417 kg (919 lb).[3] They are
                also the largest extant terrestrial ectotherms. [4]</h1><br>

        <div class="desc2">
            <h1>With lifespans in the wild of over 100 years, it is one of the longest-lived vertebrates. Captive
                 Galapagos tortoises can live up to 177 years.[5] For example, a captive individual, Harriet,
                  lived for at least 175 years. Spanish explorers, who discovered the islands in the 16th
                   century, named them after the Spanish galápago, meaning "tortoise".[6]

            <h1>Galápagos tortoises are native to seven of the Galápagos Islands. Shell size and shape vary between
                 subspecies and populations. On islands with humid highlands, the tortoises are larger, with domed
                  shells and short necks; on islands with dry lowlands, the tortoises are smaller, with "saddleback"
                   shells and long necks. Charles Darwin's observations of these differences on the second voyage
                    of the Beagle in 1835, contributed to the development of his theory of evolution.</h1><br>
        </div>

        <div class="desc4">
            <h1>Tortoise numbers declined from over 250,000 in the 16th century to a low of around 15,000 in the 1970s.
                 This decline was caused by overexploitation of the subspecies for meat and oil, habitat clearance
                  for agriculture, and introduction of non-native animals to the islands, such as rats, goats, and
                   pigs. The extinction of most giant tortoise lineages is thought to have also been caused by
                    predation by humans or human ancestors, as the tortoises themselves have no natural
                     predators. Tortoise populations on at least three islands have become extinct in
                      historical times due to human activities.</h1><br>
