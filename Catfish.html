        <h1>The walking catfish (Clarias batrachus) is a species of freshwater airbreathing catfish native to Southeast
             Asia. It is named for its ability to "walk" and wiggle across dry land, to find food or suitable environments.
              While it does not truly walk as most bipeds or quadrupeds do, it has the ability to use its pectoral fins
               to keep it upright as it makes a wiggling motion with snakelike movements to traverse land.[2] This fish
                normally lives in slow-moving and often stagnant waters in ponds, swamps, streams, and rivers, as well
                 as in flooded rice paddies, or temporary pools that may dry up.</h1><br>

        <div class="desc2">
            <h1>When this happens, its "walking" skill allows the fish to move to other aquatic environments. Considerable
                 taxonomic confusion surrounds this species and it has frequently been confused with other close relatives.
                 [3][4] One main distinction between the walking catfish and the native North American ictalurid catfish
                  with which it sometimes is confused, is that the walking catfish lacks an adipose fin.[5]
            </h1><br>
        </div>

        <div class="desc3">
            <h1>Although the cat is a social species, it is a solitary hunter. As a predator, it is crepuscular, i.e.
                 most active at dawn and dusk. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears,
                 such as those made by mice and other small mammals.[7] It also secretes and perceives pheromones.[8]</h1><br>
        </div>

        <div class="desc4">
            <h1>The walking catfish has an elongated body shape and reaches almost 0.5 m (1.6 ft) in length and 1.2 kg
                 (2.6 lb) in weight.[3] Often covered laterally in small white spots, the body is mainly coloured a
                  gray or grayish brown.[5] This catfish has long-based dorsal and anal fins,[5] as well as several
                   pairs of sensory barbels. The skin is scaleless, but covered with mucus, which protects the fish
                    when it is out of water.</h1><br>
        </div>
        
        <div class="desc5">
            <h1>This fish needs to be handled carefully when fishing it due to its embedded sting or thorn-like
                 defensive mechanism hidden behind its fins (including the middle ones before the tail fin, similar
                  to the majority of all catfishes).]</h1><br>
        </div>

        <div class="desc6">
            <h1>In the wild, this creature is omnivorous; it feeds on smaller fish, molluscs, and other invertebrates,
                 as well as detritus and aquatic weeds. It is a voracious eater that consumes food supplies rapidly,
                  so it is considered harmful when invasive.[6]</h1><br>
