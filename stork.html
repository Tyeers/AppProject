        <h1>The shoebill (Balaeniceps rex) also known as the whalebill, whale-headed stork or shoe-billed stork,
             is a very large long-legged wading bird. It derives its name from its enormous shoe-shaped bill.
              It has a somewhat stork-like overall form and has previously been classified with the storks in
               the order Ciconiiformes based on this morphology. However, genetic evidence places it with
                pelicans and herons in the Pelecaniformes. The adult is mainly grey while the juveniles
                 are more brown. It lives in tropical East Africa in large swamps from South Sudan to
                  Zambia.</h1><br>

        <div class="desc2">
            <h1>The shoebill may have been known to Ancient Egyptians[3] but was not classified until the
                 19th century, after skins and eventually live specimens were brought to Europe. John Gould
                  very briefly described it in 1850 from the skin of a specimen collected on the upper
                   White Nile by the English traveller Mansfield Parkyns. Gould provided a more detailed
                    description in the following year. He placed the species in its own genus Balaeniceps
                     and coined the binomial name Balaeniceps rex.[4][5][6] The genus name comes from the
                      Latin words balaena "whale", and caput "head", abbreviated to -ceps in compound words.
                      [7] Alternative common names are whalebill,[8] shoe-billed stork and whale-headed stork.[9]

            <h1>Two fossilized relatives of the shoebill have been described: Goliathia from the early Oligocene
                 of Egypt and Paludavis from the Early Miocene of the same country. It has been suggested that
                  the enigmatic African fossil bird Eremopezus was a relative too, but the evidence for that
                   is unconfirmed. All that is known of Eremopezus is that it was a very large, probably
                    flightless bird with a flexible foot, allowing it to handle either vegetation or
                     prey.</h1><br>

            <h1>The shoebill is a tall bird, with a typical height range of 110 to 140 cm (43 to 55 in) and some specimens
                 reaching as much as 152 cm (60 in). Length from tail to beak can range from 100 to 140 cm (39 to 55 in)
                  and wingspan is 230 to 260 cm (7 ft 7 in to 8 ft 6 in). Weight has reportedly ranged from 4 to 7 kg
                   (8.8 to 15.4 lb). A male will weigh on average around 5.6 kg (12 lb) and is larger than a typical
                    female of 4.9 kg (11 lb).[15] The signature feature of the species is its huge, bulbous bill,
                     which is straw-coloured with erratic greyish markings.</h1><br>
