        <h1>The bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) is a bird of prey found in North America. A sea eagle, it has
             two known subspecies and forms a species pair with the white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla),
              which occupies the same niche as the bald eagle in the Palearctic. Its range includes most of
               Canada and Alaska, all of the contiguous United States, and northern Mexico. It is found
                near large bodies of open water with an abundant food supply and old-growth trees for
                 nesting.</h1><br>

        <div class="desc2">
            <h1>The bald eagle is an opportunistic feeder which subsists mainly on fish, which it swoops down upon
                 and snatches from the water with its talons. It builds the largest nest of any North American
                  bird and the largest tree nests ever recorded for any animal species, up to 4 m (13 ft)
                   deep, 2.5 m (8.2 ft) wide, and 1 metric ton (1.1 short tons) in weight. Sexual maturity
                    is attained at the age of four to five years.
            </h1><br>

        <div class="desc3">
            <h1>Bald eagles are not actually bald; the name derives from an older meaning of the word, "white headed".
                 The adult is mainly brown with a white head and tail. The sexes are identical in plumage, but females
                  are about 25 percent larger than males. The yellow beak is large and hooked. The plumage of the
                   immature is brown.</h1><br>

        <div class="desc4">
            <h1>The bald eagle is the national bird of the United States of America and appears on its seal. In the
                 late 20th century it was on the brink of extirpation in the contiguous United States. Populations
                  have since recovered, and the species's status was upgraded from "endangered" to "threatened"
                   in 1995, and removed from the list altogether in 2007.</h1><br>
