        <h1>A waterfall is any point in a river or stream where water flows over a vertical drop or a series of steep
             drops. Waterfalls also occur where meltwater drops over the edge of a tabular iceberg or ice shelf.</h1><br>

        <div class="desc2">
            <h1>Waterfalls can be formed in several ways, but the most common method of formation is that a river
                 courses over a top layer of resistant bedrock before falling on to softer rock, which erodes faster,
                  leading to an increasingly high fall. Waterfalls have been studied for their impact on species
                   living in and around them.</h1><br>

        <div class="desc3">
            <h1>Humans have had a distinct relationship with waterfalls for years, travelling to see them, exploring
                 and naming them. They can present formidable barriers to navigation along rivers. Waterfalls are
                  religious sites in many cultures. Since the 18th century they have received increased attention as
                   tourist destinations, sources of hydropower, and—particularly since the mid-20th century—as subjects
                    of research.</h1><br>
