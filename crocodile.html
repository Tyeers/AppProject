        <h1>Crocodiles (family Crocodylidae) or true crocodiles are large semiaquatic reptiles that live throughout the
             tropics in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Australia. The term crocodile is sometimes used even more loosely
             to include all extant members of the order Crocodilia, which includes the alligators and caimans (family
             Alligatoridae), the gharial and false gharial (family Gavialidae) among other extinct taxa.</h1><br>

        <div class="desc2">
            <h1>Although they appear similar, crocodiles, alligators and the gharial belong to separate biological families.
                 The gharial, with its narrow snout, is easier to distinguish, while morphological differences are more
                  difficult to spot in crocodiles and alligators. The most obvious external differences are visible in
                   the head, with crocodiles having narrower and longer heads, with a more V-shaped than a U-shaped snout
                    compared to alligators and caimans. Another obvious trait is that the upper and lower jaws of the
                     crocodiles are the same width, and the teeth in the lower jaw fall along the edge or outside the
                      upper jaw when the mouth is closed; therefore, all teeth are visible, unlike an alligator, which
                       possesses in the upper jaw small depressions into which the lower teeth fit. Also, when the
                        crocodile's mouth is closed, the large fourth tooth in the lower jaw fits into a constriction
                         in the upper jaw. For hard-to-distinguish specimens, the protruding tooth is the most reliable
                          feature to define the species' family.[1] Crocodiles have more webbing on the toes of the hind
                           feet and can better tolerate saltwater due to specialized salt glands for filtering out salt,
                            which are present, but non-functioning, in alligators. Another trait that separates crocodiles
                             from other crocodilians is their much higher levels of aggression.[2]
            </h1><br>

        <div class="desc3">
            <h1>Crocodile size, morphology, behaviour and ecology differ somewhat among species. However, they have many
                 similarities in these areas as well. All crocodiles are semiaquatic and tend to congregate in freshwater
                  habitats such as rivers, lakes, wetlands and sometimes in brackish water and saltwater. They are
                   carnivorous animals, feeding mostly on vertebrates such as fish, reptiles, birds and mammals, and
                    sometimes on invertebrates such as molluscs and crustaceans, depending on species and age. All crocodiles
                     are tropical species that, unlike alligators, are very sensitive to cold. They separated from other 
                     crocodilians during the Eocene epoch, about 55 million years ago.[3] Many species are at the risk of
                      extinction, some being classified as critically endangered.</h1><br>
