        <h1>The bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas), also known as the Zambezi shark (informally zambi) in Africa and Lake
             Nicaragua shark in Nicaragua, is a species of requiem shark commonly found worldwide in warm, shallow
              waters along coasts and in rivers. It is known for its aggressive nature, and presence mainly in warm,
               shallow brackish and freshwater systems including estuaries and (usually) lower reaches of rivers. This
                aggressive nature is a reason for its population being listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List.
                 Shark-culling occurs near beaches to protect beach goers, which is one of the causes of bull shark
                  populations continuing to decrease.[3]</h1><br>

        <div class="desc2">
            <h1>Bull sharks are euryhaline and can thrive in both salt and fresh water. They are known to travel
                 far up rivers, and have been known to travel up the Mississippi River as far as Alton, Illinois,
                 [4] about 1,100 kilometres (700 mi) from the ocean, but few freshwater interactions with humans
                  have been recorded. Larger-sized bull sharks are probably responsible for the majority of
                   nearshore shark attacks, including many incidents of shark bites attributed to other species.[5]

            <h1>The name "bull shark" comes from the shark's stocky shape, broad, flat snout, and aggressive,
                unpredictable behavior.[6] In India, the bull shark may be confused with the Sundarbans or Ganges
                 shark. In Africa, it is also commonly called the Zambezi River shark, or just "zambi".</h1>
                 <h1>
                    Its wide range and diverse habitats result in many other local names, including Ganges River shark,
                   Fitzroy Creek whaler, van Rooyen's shark, Lake Nicaragua shark,[7] river shark, freshwater
                    whaler, estuary whaler, Swan River whaler,[8] cub shark, and shovelnose shark.[9]
