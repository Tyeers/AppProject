        <h1>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India.
             It has a muscular, broad-chested body; short, rounded head; round ears; and a hairy tuft
              at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than
               females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides.
                A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of
                 female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an
                  apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and
                   have been known to hunt humans, lions typically do not actively seek out and prey on humans.</h1><br>

        <div class="desc2">
            <h1>The lion inhabits grasslands, savannahs and shrublands. It is usually more diurnal than other
                 wild cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. During
                  the Neolithic period, the lion ranged throughout Africa and Eurasia from Southeast Europe
                   to India, but it has been reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one
                    population in western India. It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since
                     1996 because populations in African countries have declined by about 43% since the early
                      1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the
                       cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans
                        are the greatest causes for concern.

            <h1>One of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture, the lion has been extensively
                 depicted in sculptures and paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature.
                  Lions have been kept in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire and have been a key species
                   sought for exhibition in zoological gardens across the world since the late 18th century. Cultural
                    depictions of lions were prominent in Ancient Egypt, and depictions have occurred in virtually
                     all ancient and medieval cultures in the lion's historic and current range.</h1><br>
