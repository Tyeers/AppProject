        <h1>The black mamba (Dendroaspis polylepis) is a species of highly venomous snake belonging to the family Elapidae.
             It is native to parts of sub-Saharan Africa. First formally described by Albert GÃ¼nther in 1864, it is the 
             second-longest venomous snake after the king cobra; mature specimens generally exceed 2 m (6 ft 7 in) and 
             commonly grow to 3 m (9.8 ft). Specimens of 4.3 to 4.5 m (14 to 15 ft) have been reported. Its skin colour
              varies from grey to dark brown. Juvenile black mambas tend to be paler than adults and darken with age.</h1><br>

        <div class="desc2">
            <h1>The species is both terrestrial (ground-living) and arboreal (tree-living); it inhabits savannah,
                 woodland, rocky slopes and in some regions, dense forest. It is diurnal and is known to prey on
                  birds and small mammals. Over suitable surfaces, it can move at speeds up to 16 km/h (10 mph)
                   for short distances. Adult black mambas have few natural predators.
            </h1><br>
        </div>

        <div class="desc3">
            <h1>In a threat display, the black mamba usually opens its inky-black mouth, spreads its narrow
                 neck-flap and sometimes hisses. It is capable of striking at considerable range and may deliver
                  a series of bites in rapid succession. Its venom is primarily composed of neurotoxins that often
                   induce symptoms within ten minutes, and is frequently fatal unless antivenom is administered.
                    Despite its reputation as a formidable and highly aggressive species, the black mamba attacks
                     humans only if it is threatened or cornered. It is rated as least concern on the International
                      Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)'s Red List of Threatened Species.</h1><br>
        </div>

        <div class="desc4">
            <h1>The black mamba is a long, slender, cylindrical snake. It has a coffin-shaped head with a somewhat
                 pronounced brow ridge and a medium-sized eye.[12][13] The adult snake's length typically ranges
                  from 2 to 3 m (6 ft 7 in to 9 ft 10 in) but specimens have grown to lengths of 4.3 to 4.5 m
                   (14 ft 1 in to 14 ft 9 in).[10][13] It is the longest species of venomous snake in Africa[14][15]
                    and the second-longest venomous snake species overall, exceeded in length only by the king cobra.
                    [16] The black mamba is a proteroglyphous (front-fanged) snake, with fangs up to 6.5 mm (0.26 in)
                     in length,[17] located at the front of the maxilla.[16] The tail of the species is long and thin,
                      the caudal vertebrae making up 17-25% of its body length.[12] The body mass of black mambas has
                       been reported to be about 1.6 kg (3.5 lb),[18] although a study of seven black mambas found an
                        average weight of 1.03 kg (2.3 lb), ranging from 520 g (18 oz) for a specimen of 1.01 m (3 ft 4 in)
                         total length to 2.4 kg (5.3 lb) for a specimen of 2.57 m (8 ft 5 in) total length.[19]</h1><br>
